### Session 2 (2026-04-21T09:52:55Z) — pre-reflect gate removal, dirty-tree narrowing, retired-path pruning, hand-off convention

- Worked four backlog tasks to completion in a single session: (1) collapse the pre-reflect gate, (2) narrow the dirty-tree warning, (3) prune stale `skills/` paths, (4) preserve hand-offs across the analyse-work → triage boundary.
- All four tasks shipped with tests; the suite was green at end of session.
- The gate removal exposed two test failures: the `pi_phase_cycle` fake-pi script looped because it always wrote `git-commit-work` regardless of phase (fixed with a phase-aware case statement), and `pivot_run_stack_short_circuit_pivot` errored on missing `reflect.md` config (fixed by seeding all five phase configs).
- `ContractMockAgent::invoke_headless` for `Triage` was changed from overwrite to append so the safety-net test can observe analyse-work's status flips after the full cycle completes.
- The hand-off convention (analyse-work.md + triage.md) is now live in shipped prompts; the next real session that produces a hand-off is the first end-to-end exercise.
- No implementation work began on the two larger tasks still `not_started`: coordinator-plan creation and the structured-state research task.
